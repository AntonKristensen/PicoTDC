Same as with the 100OhmTests, but I desoldered the 2 50Ohm resistors,
so that it is only the internal quench resistor from the SiPM that is 
decharged over. This should improve timing performance, but I might
not be able to see it in these two data sets as the oscilloscope is only
at 200MHz bandwidth.
