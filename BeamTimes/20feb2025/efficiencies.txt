Efficiency estimates for two scintillators, number is ratio of neutron in to matched neutron event

z diff 50, x diff 5 -> 1.9e-6
z diff 10, x diff 1 -> 4.3e-5
z diff 5, x diff 1 -> 1.6e-4
z diff 2, x diff 2 -> 1.4e-4
z diff 2, x diff 1 -> 5.6e-4






Flux rate estimates from Villad's spallation setup, from pencil beam in the middle
10cm from end: 1.02e-4 neutrons, 0.82e-4 gammas
25cm from end: 0.32e-4 neutrons, 0.24e-4 gammas
10cm from end: 0.60e-4 neutrons, 0.52e-4 gammas # 10cm off centerline


Flux rate estimates from just putting in a big chunk of brass:
10cm from end: 0.70e-4 neutrons, 0.34e-4 gammas
